( His eyes said yes in that one scene ? )  That was my take as a 21 year old back then -  Great movie my parents bought me a VHS  copy for my birthday back then in 83 /84 !  -  Much better than the second movie - As much as it was an engaging story - I think the cast were wrong - one guy in it just plays the same person in all his movies ...Himself - he spoiled it !

A new science fiction film premiered on June 25 and every scheduled showing across The City of Los Angeles on that day was sold out. A day later, I was fortunate to arrive early enough at the Fox Theatre in Westwood Village, in L.A. Two friends and I anticipated all that would appear before us, on the silver screen. No one in the audience had seen the film yet, and Warner Brothers Studios conducted a campaign to divulge very little about Blade Runner before it opened. Mystery, suspense and surprise can go a long way. I never saw the official trailer; apparently, most of the audience never viewed it. At the cinema, we didn&#39;t know the marvels that waited for us.<br>There was a startled reaction in the sold out crowd, when the words LOS ANGELES NOVEMBER 2019 appeared in the very first scene. Remember, it&#39;s June 26, 1982 and we&#39;re Angelenos, seeing Blade Runner on it&#39;s second day of the opening weekend. Los Angeles! Our city! The Future! You could tell, everyone was already doing math on the distance of Time to The Future. Thirty seven years from now! <br>For the rest of the showing it was absolute silence, shock or gasps of surprise. It was overwhelming to behold. We were dazzled. Flying cars! Tremendous architecture and extraordinary displays of electric and Neon lights! Those huge, incredible motion image billboards! Gliding above the skyline, casting shadows on everything below, the unexpected visual magic of advertising zeppelins. WOW. And Replicants, and animatronic, robotic birds. We saw technology beyond 1982. There was so much more to discover in L.A.&#39;s metropolis, in this future time: Underground subway systems, redefined public transport, redesigned traffic signals on crowded streets. Those enticing outdoor dining centers, audio visual telephone communications, a different spending currency, the New Style, the New Vogue Look, the nightlife! <br>In an atmosphere of continuous, overcast skies and rain that fell like veils upon the city, something else captured our senses. As each scene unfolded before us, through it all, weaving a tapestry of sound and mood, the nocturnal, beautiful and melancholy soundtrack composed by Vangelis.<br>One particular, heartbreaking sequence brought many people to tears. It happened to me and I wasn&#39;t alone in that moment, in the dark of this crowded theatre. <br>When the film ended, most of us stayed until the final credit rolled by. Angelenos, enthralled, bewildered, enraptured by our city, in November, 2019. Conversations began in the lobby, as crowds made their exit: &quot;This is L.A. in the future?&quot; &quot;Will it really be like this?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready for this!&quot; &quot;How much of this could happen?&quot; &quot;Will we live to see it come true?&quot; <br>It was so strange to leave the cinema, stepping outside into sunshine daylight. No clouds, no rain, no darkened sky. All too soon we returned to the Present. <br>That was June 26, 1982. Today is November 8, 2019. I was there, 37 years ago. I&#39;ve lived to see The Future.

UgyJyOyVjODu6LoOKOt4AaABAg.915Hu1pEGKJ9PrpMqEWTFr,@rohanmarkjay,"Hey thanks for that. I love hearing about how Angelenos felt about their city and going to the cinema in 1982 in Los Angeles. Going to movies back then was a true exciting cinema experience. I suppose you can replicate it at home in a darkened room with large flatscreen tv or with a projector or watch at a cinema near  your neck of the woods that reruns these old movies because they were classics. It has to be noted that on its initial run, it did not do well. However on subsequent viewings in following years people started to appreciate Blade Runner as a great work of art. You could say it was Ridley Scotts Mona Lisa. However making movies is a big team effort sports team. No one person should take credit,  normally involving talented people from a lot of countries from around the world as well as a number of talented Brits and Americans, everyone&#39;s talents are contributed to produce the final product when they all converged on Los Angeles in the early 1980s to produce this movie in the movie backlots in sunny Los Angeles. The antisesis of the Los Angeles in the movie. Sure Ridley Scott might get all the credit. But we should not forget the contribution of everyone involved. However it is a bleak film for me and for a lot of other people except for the optimistic ending. Which is why I rarely watch it. But whenever I watch it. I am aware I am watching a very deep film very different from the other movies. This is movie making as a great work of art. The central theme of the movies is it asks the philsophical question and examines what it means to be human or an artificial intelligence and if spiritual consciosness, can also manifest in humanity creation the replicants and they learn at the end of the film what it means to be human or a sentient feeling thinking being, trying to find answers to life what is it all about. The replicants ask that deep question too that humans have always asked in this movie as well and Batty goes from being evil to good as he becomes more spiritually aware when he saves deckards life. He has ascended spiritually. Its a very deep film on many levels. Everytime you watch it you learn something new of what it means to be human in high tech world or a creation of a human in a high tech world.",1,2021-07-16 16:59:17+00:00,"Saturday afternoon, June 26, 1982: I was 27 years old.
