In fact, it disclosed very little of the storyline, although it contained a lot of dialogue and narration. It did show some of the impressive sets, though. To me, it looked like a futuristic &quot;Dragnet&quot; episode, which, basically, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is. But seeing the trailer, I was unable to determine that the plot of the film revolved around artificial humans at all ; as I said, I thought it was simply a crime drama set in the future, and the trailer didn&#39;t pique my interest at all. Finally three years later I rented a vhs copy of it, and it knocked me out !  I was disgusted with myself for not having given myself the pleasure of seeing it on the big screen. Such a kickass sci fi film ! Both visually astonishing and intelligent. About ten years later, I heard about Jean Luc Goddard&#39;s 1965 &quot;Alphaville&quot; and bought a VHS copy of it sight unseen. Another truly remarkable sci fi film which definitely inspired Ridley Scott&#39;s second science fiction masterpiece, the first being &quot;Alien&quot;, of course.",2,2020-01-14 09:57:38+00:00,

UgyJyOyVjODu6LoOKOt4AaABAg,@joemacpherson1664,"Saturday afternoon, June 26, 1982: I was 27 years old. A new science fiction film premiered on June 25 and every scheduled showing across The City of Los Angeles on that day was sold out. A day later, I was fortunate to arrive early enough at the Fox Theatre in Westwood Village, in L.A. Two friends and I anticipated all that would appear before us, on the silver screen. No one in the audience had seen the film yet, and Warner Brothers Studios conducted a campaign to divulge very little about Blade Runner before it opened. Mystery, suspense and surprise can go a long way. I never saw the official trailer; apparently, most of the audience never viewed it. At the cinema, we didn&#39;t know the marvels that waited for us.<br>There was a startled reaction in the sold out crowd, when the words LOS ANGELES NOVEMBER 2019 appeared in the very first scene. Remember, it&#39;s June 26, 1982 and we&#39;re Angelenos, seeing Blade Runner on it&#39;s second day of the opening weekend. Los Angeles! Our city! The Future! You could tell, everyone was already doing math on the distance of Time to The Future. Thirty seven years from now! <br>For the rest of the showing it was absolute silence, shock or gasps of surprise. It was overwhelming to behold. We were dazzled. Flying cars! Tremendous architecture and extraordinary displays of electric and Neon lights! Those huge, incredible motion image billboards! Gliding above the skyline, casting shadows on everything below, the unexpected visual magic of advertising zeppelins. WOW. And Replicants, and animatronic, robotic birds. We saw technology beyond 1982. There was so much more to discover in L.A.&#39;s metropolis, in this future time: Underground subway systems, redefined public transport, redesigned traffic signals on crowded streets. Those enticing outdoor dining centers, audio visual telephone communications, a different spending currency, the New Style, the New Vogue Look, the nightlife! <br>In an atmosphere of continuous, overcast skies and rain that fell like veils upon the city, something else captured our senses. As each scene unfolded before us, through it all, weaving a tapestry of sound and mood, the nocturnal, beautiful and melancholy soundtrack composed by Vangelis.<br>One particular, heartbreaking sequence brought many people to tears. It happened to me and I wasn&#39;t alone in that moment, in the dark of this crowded theatre. <br>When the film ended, most of us stayed until the final credit rolled by. Angelenos, enthralled, bewildered, enraptured by our city, in November, 2019. Conversations began in the lobby, as crowds made their exit: &quot;This is L.A. in the future?&quot; &quot;Will it really be like this?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready for this!&quot; &quot;How much of this could happen?&quot; &quot;Will we live to see it come true?&quot; <br>It was so strange to leave the cinema, stepping outside into sunshine daylight. No clouds, no rain, no darkened sky. All too soon we returned to the Present. <br>That was June 26, 1982. Today is November 8, 2019. I was there, 37 years ago. I&#39;ve lived to see The Future. It&#39;s not quite what was foreseen but ever since that Saturday afternoon, long ago, Blade Runner is my favorite Science Fiction Film above all others. Long live The Future!",1205,2019-11-08 22:41:53+00:00,

Perhaps it could come sooner depending on how the technology and scientists evolve their work. The Blade Runner 2019 future would not exist until 2319 perhaps and Back to the Future 2 future in the real world would be 200 to 300 years away from now.,6,2018-12-29 17:05:17+00:00,

Didn&#39;t kill enough replicants: I mean Dekard is called a Blade Runner so I expected him to do all this bad ass stuff and kill at least 10 replicants. You know, to establish what he does for a living and yet he only really kills 2 out of six for what I remember. One of them got killed by the girl replicant who helped him, the main one died on his own, and as for the other 2 I forgot. He&#39;s supposed to be the best at his job yet he only kills 2 out of 6 without any help I mean come now.<br><br>b. Didn&#39;t seem that futuristic: Okay, we have replicants (whatever the fuck those are, movie doesn&#39;t make it really clear, I mean are they robots, cyborgs, clones, grown lifeforms, what are they?), a machine that&#39;s supposed to identfiy replicants), hover cars, space colonization, robot animals, bigger buildings, some kind of computer you zoom in on things with, and that&#39;s pretty much it. Our current year of 2016 is WAY more high tech other than the &quot;future&quot; elements that movie did portray. We have smart phones, blade less fans, hd tvs, green energy such as solar power, electronic cigarettes, LED embelled clothing and more. Movie didn&#39;t do a good job of convincing that this is the future. Also what&#39;s with all the fucking oil refineries in the movie? Oil use is declining in real life and yet in the movie Los Angeles appears to have more oil refineries up the butt than ever before. <br><br>c. Was very bland: Seriously it feels like NOTHING happened in the movie. Mostly just talking and traveling from one point of Los Angeles to the other. Very little fighting as I mentioned in subpoint a. This is supposed to be the best science fiction movie of all time yet barely anything happens and what does happen is super dull?  <br><br>2. Story was hard to follow: Okay as I stated above not much happened making the movie very simplistic yet I STILL couldn&#39;t follow it! I didn&#39;t know what the characters were doing and why plus I couldn&#39;t remember who anyone&#39;s name. Also I barely remember who anyone was! Okay you&#39;ve got Deckard, the blade runner, his replicant lover, Deckards bosses, the replicants, a key guy who worked them, a toy maker, etc. <br><br>I&#39;ll finish the rest of this comment later.",0,2017-05-18 16:00:03+00:00,
